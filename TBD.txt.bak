TBD:

1) Fix cross-browser compatability and basic CSS layout
2) Design database and XML
3) Convert tree layout to read XML (full into including vars on each supported criteria) -- http://www.w3schools.com/DOM/dom_loadxmldoc.asp
4) Tree layout mouse-over with jQuery
5) PHP to generate XML from NEDI / LDAP
6) Sidebar functionality (hit counter)
7) Nice CSS (see JP)
